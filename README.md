# Java Learning

This repository was created to document my learning in Java. It contains practical examples, exercises, and fundamental concepts of the language, and it will be updated as I improve my knowledge.

# Repository Structure

- **Operators**: Examples and exercises on arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
- **Decision Structures**: Codes that cover conditional structures like `if`, `else if`, and `switch`.

# How to Set Up and Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed.
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexSousa4/Java-Learning.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Folder**:
   - Enter the folder corresponding to the example you wish to run.

4. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```

5. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

# Improvements Made for Functionality

- **Organization**: Each example is in a separate folder, with clear names reflecting the content.
- **Autonomy**: Currently, there are no external dependencies; only the JDK is required. If any external dependencies are needed, I will update the README.
- **Comments**: Each file contains comments explaining the purpose of the code.

# Next Steps

- Add examples of loop structures (for, while, do-while).
- Implement examples of collection handling (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.).
- Explore object-oriented concepts (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).
